## Why

The project currently lacks a single, reliable baseline document that captures what exists today across code, infrastructure, and workflows. Creating this now reduces onboarding time, prevents assumption drift, and gives future changes a shared reference point.

## What Changes

- Add a baseline documentation set that describes the current state of the project (architecture, major modules, infrastructure assets, build/run/test workflows, and key constraints).
- Define required coverage and structure so baseline documentation is complete, consistent, and reviewable.
- Define maintenance expectations so the baseline stays aligned with project evolution.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `project-baseline-documentation`: Define requirements for creating and maintaining a project current-state baseline that is accurate, navigable, and actionable for contributors.

### Modified Capabilities
- None.

## Impact

- Affected areas: repository documentation and OpenSpec artifacts.
- Affected systems: developer onboarding and project planning workflows.
- Dependencies/APIs: no runtime API or dependency changes.
